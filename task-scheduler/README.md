# Task Scheduler (STM32)

## Project 
I built a cooperative task scheduler on the STM32F4 Discovery board using SysTick and PendSV exceptions to toggle four LEDs concurrently, baremetal style.

It also includes custom startup code, a linker script, and a Makefile, so you can see how this project is built and linked from scratch on a MCU.

## What I Learned
- **SysTick & PendSV**: How to set up periodic system ticks and trigger context-switching exceptions to run multiple tasks concurrently 
- **Context Switching & Scheduling**: What happens when the processor saves and restores a task's state, and how round-robin scheduling works.
- **Stack Management & Execution Flow**: How each task needs its own stack and how the Cortex-M handles moving in and out of tasks without messing up memory via execution exit and entry standards.   
- **Debugging Hard Faults**: Using step-through debugging, inspecting disassembly, and reading fault registers to identify and fix runtime crashes.  
- **Task Info Tracking**: How to clearly track each taskâ€™s status, handlers, and stack pointer using structured tables for better scheduling control.  
- **Bare-Metal Build & Linking**: Created a custom startup file, linker script, and Makefile from scratch to see how the code actually gets loaded onto the MCU without an OS in between.
