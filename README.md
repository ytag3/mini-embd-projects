# Embedded Systems Mini-Projects

A collection of tiny embedded systems projects built during my self-study in ARM Cortex-M development, inspired by *FastBit Embedded Academy* courses. Each project targets a core skill in bare-metal programming, peripheral control, interrupt handling and basic RTOS usage.

## Projects

- **[task-scheduler/](./task-scheduler)** – Cooperative multitasking using SysTick and PendSV to toggle LEDs on an STM32F4
- *(More projects coming soon…)*

## Skills & Concepts

- ARM Cortex-M register-level programming
- Interrupt handling and NVIC configuration
- Debugging via disassembly, step through (gdb and openOCD), and fault registers
- Building and linking and compiling baremetal style

##  About

Part of my learning path towards a solid foundation in embedded firmware development. These projects document my growth in **microcontroller fundamentals** through hands-on, working code.
